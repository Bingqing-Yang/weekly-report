Done:
1. For linear probes, BP-test to detect heteroskedasticity;
2. For those linear probes with heteroskedasticity using weighted least square to generate prediction Interval;
3. Optimized code to 220 lines;

TODO:
1. Keep on moditying code;
2. Find a quantitative methods to detect heteroskedasticity in nonlinear probes, residual plot is blurry;
3. Derivation formula of PI in weight-scam;
