Dear Professor David,

I went through the text exchange a few times and try to identify the gap. Please see below for the items that I think that I should pay attention to. Please let me know if anything else needs to be added. 


1. Identify the issue and communicate clearly with more detail. For examples the inaccessible link. Provide the feedback more rapidly. 
2. Get my priorities correct, for instance, My assignment is more important than persuading noel. 
3. Follow standard procedure, for example, use git instead of downloading the file. 
4. Avoid making assumptions and communicate directly. Eg, assuming that you wonâ€™t needed to be informed after the link is accessible.

I feel that I am still have some language barriers after 2 months in school. Myself is also frustrated and sometimes gets distracted. I am very concerned that you mentioned about my probation, but I appreciate your direct communication. 

Thank you and looking forward to hearing your feedback.
