Done:
1. log(|res|) looks better when contrast log(|res|) and log(res^2) of genes fitted in linear model;
2. scatter plot log(|res|) seems nonlinear trend, so I use loess to fit it and select the optimal span by MSE in leave-one-out cross validation;
3. Finish the duties of setup-linux on github;
4. Configuring tmux shortcuts

Todo:
1. Look at scatter plot with PI based on loess;
2. Check SCAM;
