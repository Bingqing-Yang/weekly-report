Done:
1. For linear probes, BP-test to detect heteroskedasticity;
2. For those linear probes with heteroskedasticity using weighted least square to generate prediction Interval;
3. Optimized code to 220 lines;

TODO:
1. Keep on moditying code;
2. Find a quantitative methods to detect heteroskedasticity in nonlinear probes, residual plot is blurry;
3. Derivation formula of PI in weight-scam;

Question:
1. why the predicted line of weighted-scam is stange?
2. does have anyone to quantify heteroskedasticity of nonlinear model?

Find:
1. choose negative square of model residual as weights in scam(), and heteroskedasticity seems better from residual plot but AIC of weight-scam increased;
2. even weighted-scam, heteroskedasticity still appear in residual plot;
