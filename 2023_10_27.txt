Done:
1) ncvTest() check heteroskedasticity in linear model;
2) Use Feasible weighted least square for linear model;
3) Impletment function of standard_residual scatter plot;
4) Find scam took a long time for some gene with specific k' parameter;
      --> neglect the model of scam(k = k')

Todo:
1) Organize note about OLS, GLS, WLS;
2) Resolve heteroskedasticity in nonlinear model;
