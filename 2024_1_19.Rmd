## 1. Choosing four residual models:

`res2_loess`,`res2_loess_noexp`,`res_loess`,`res_loess_noexp`. It does not contain linear model.

-   For some genes, using linear model to explain their variation is not suitable;

-   For other genes, linear model as residual model is suitable, but loess model includes that one;

## 2. Check does different residual models have significant difference among first 200 genes:

-   Boxplot:

    From the boxplot we could know that different residual models do not have obvious overlap.

\newpage

-   One-way ANOVA test:

    From the table, $p-value \ll 0$, we could known that different residual models have significant difference.

|            | Df  | Sum Sq | Mean Sq | F value | Pr(\>F) |
|------------|-----|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Model_name | 3   | 7416   | 2472.0  | 4321    | \<2e-16 |
| Residuals  | 796 | 455    | 0.6     |         |         |

## 3. Comparing four residual models among first 200 genes:

We could conclude that `res2_loess_noexp` is the best residual model from AIC. The rate of being in prediction interval is about $0.95$ when level is equal to $0.95$, but the rate of being in prediction interval slightly higher than $0.5$ when level is equal to $0.5$.

|               | res2_loess | res2_loess_noexp | res_loess | res_loess_noexp |
|---------------|------------|------------------|-----------|-----------------|
| AIC           | 2.616241   | -4.721434        | 1.229946  | -3.277581       |
| Ratio_in_0.95 | 0.714966   | 0.9517857        | 0.714966  | 0.8890986       |
| Ratio_in_0.5  | 0.2853571  | 0.5227211        | 0.2853571 | 0.4206122       |

## 4. Generating scatter plots of that four residual models among first 200 genes:

-   Look at four .pdf files;

## 5. Selecting genes that show much discrepancy between different type of residual models among first 200 genes:

-   `res2_loess_noexp` VS `res2_loess`:

    residual model without log is much robust but the other is flexible, showing poor generalization ;

    residual model without log is more representative of fluctuations in variance changes;

-   `res2_loess_noexp` VS `res_loess_noexp`:

## 6. Reflect why what I calculate $R^{2}$ is negative:

The detail below is wrong, please omit that.

-   Do not understand the definition of $R^2$;
-   Do not understand the definition of residual model;


## 7. Finished the first step of transaction and getting to know batch effect removal

## 8. TODO:

-   Understand and run the code of batch effect removal, includeing rank, combat, quantile, normalize against sensitive group, PCA plot;

-   Understand and run the code of deconvolution, including GTM-decon, deMixT, Cibersortx;

-   Revise my project and consult to professor;

## **Modification on item 6**

credit from David:

-   $R^2 = 1 - SSE/SST$ is not a universal equation, and it relies on assumptions that are not met. So the use of fomular $R^2 = 1 - SSE/SST$ is not right.

-   Instead of using $R^2$, try to use $RMSE$ because it is more reliable when the model is not linear.
