Done:
1. Organized note about prediction interval under heteroscedasticity;
2. Write code about WLS;


Finding:
1. The residual of wls is homogeneous but p-value of bptest is much small when implement linear model between exp(residual^2) and X;
2. degree freedom of residual on SCAM is given, why considered it as dim(X)[1] - length(coef(scam));


Todoï¼š
define A as the data which has samall p-value of bptest after ols and wls
1. look at true data about residual plot in original ols and wls;
2. how to deal with A; 
3. look at scatter plot of A, whether it follow linear regression;
